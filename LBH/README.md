[IMPORTANT] 

This requires vehicles/deployables to be aligned properly down the X-axis in order to function properly. Objects which require a rotational offset to function will need to be adjusted.

Some settings may make the system incompatible with certain rulesets and equipment. However, notes and code for switching these features on and off is present for those who wish to use them.

Do [not] use LBHD systems as your default LBA parser as it would not be optimized for use in equipment that has no intention of benefitting from directional damage resistances. Use a standard LBA or LBH-Slim/AG core instead.
